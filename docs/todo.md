Unify chatroom information
==========================
login/register returns
----------------------
- [ ] Make login and create\_chatroom return the same data as use\_invite. (using the helper function)


channels
--------
(channels are an un-unified mess)
- [ ] Some sort of unification between get\_readable\_channels and fetch\_all channels.
- [ ] Sorting out a bunch of other channels mess.
- [ ] Replace `public` property of channels with `rw` and have that apply by default with all classes overriding it.
