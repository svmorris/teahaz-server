# basic idea
    the mesClint program is a module for communicating witht the server
    the test.py shows in detail how it can be used
    the sever is a standalone program that distributes messages

im trying to make how the backend works today stay down the line but there might be small changes
    in general the login sequence will probably stay but not for long

# the client
    this is kinda explained in the test.py

    after the server has been run you can connect on port 8001

# the server
    just run it with python 3 and tell me if it crashes
    by defualt listens on port 8001
