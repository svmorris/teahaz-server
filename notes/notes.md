# channels
this is an idea i had of having different channels for each conversation that is going on
in detail:
    the user would connect to (eg.: port 8000) which is a hub for all the available channels 
    there the server would list the channels that he has and if the user selects one it will re connect to the server on that port  
    [obvi this would only work well if there arent more then like 100 channels but i highy doubt we would ever get there]
