this microservice will handle healthcheks


some healthcheks:

these include making sure that the server is always up to date
    - probably including an optional setting to update code if its non-breaking


occasionally running through databases to make sure everything is in tact


checking ssl
    - also maybe


probably have some basic self security checks, like checking if microservices are available to the web
    - big maybe



some other features:


adding some kind of hook function where users can write their own code for notifications
    - eg email, discord dms, etc
    - on my server this will probably be done with the th discord bot
