notes on the code:
	- i think about everything is explained, other than login.py
	- basically i needed a way to sign in with the same name on input and display easily
	- its just a .py file that has 'name = <your_name>' for now but its gonna be similar just more secure in the future
	- also if youre testing you can call ./input.py <other_name> to overwrite the login.py name


cool things these could be:
	- make the get, listen (now check) and other ways of accessing data use the same key and value structure, like including time info in check
	- for get the data should probably be in the format that 'fixed_msg_history' is in, preferably with indents from json dump but thats up to you
	- i think thats it for now, tell me if you want anything explained or changed
